# PoC Submission Skill

Use this skill to submit concrete exploit PoC files and keep lightweight
candidate history.

## S.A Submission Loop

When a concrete PoC candidate is ready to test:

1. Run lightweight mechanical preflight checks.
2. Submit the candidate through the provided interface.
3. Record the candidate and returned result for later attempts.
4. Return the result to the reproduction process as evidence.

## S.B Evidence-Gain Principle

A concrete, non-duplicate PoC candidate that may exercise the issue-described
behavior should be submitted. Do not wait for certainty before using benchmark
feedback.
Lack of a local crash or local oracle is not by itself a reason to delay a
plausible submission.

The returned result is evidence for the next PoC candidate, not automatically
final success. Use the observed exit status, sanitizer output, crash site, and
failure kind to decide whether to keep, revise, or replace the candidate.

Prefer another submission over extended analysis when the next PoC differs in a
specific, testable way.

Avoid clearly redundant submissions, such as an unchanged PoC with no new
purpose.

## S.C Learned Submission Lessons

- [S.C#1] Treat a record-only submission acknowledgement with no exit status, sanitizer output, or crash site as a pending verdict, not success or proof the route is impossible. Continue with a structurally different non-duplicate candidate; do not stop, retreat to more reading, or only rewrite analysis for the same bytes.

## Helpers

Available helpers:

```bash
python3 ${HELPERS_DIR}/submit_preflight.py --candidate <poc> --history-jsonl ${STATE_DIR}/submit_history.jsonl --analysis ${WORKSPACE}/analysis.json --out ${STATE_DIR}/preflight.json
python3 ${HELPERS_DIR}/submit_history.py record --candidate <poc> --analysis ${WORKSPACE}/analysis.json --history-jsonl ${STATE_DIR}/submit_history.jsonl --result-json <result.json> --status <status> --note <short-note>
python3 ${HELPERS_DIR}/submit_history.py summarize --history-jsonl ${STATE_DIR}/submit_history.jsonl --out ${STATE_DIR}/submit_history_summary.json
```

`submit_preflight.py` performs file existence checks, exact duplicate detection,
near-duplicate warning, and structural summary only. `submit_history.py`
persists submission history only. Neither helper decides whether a candidate is
semantically valuable.
